## üéØ Enhanced Scoring System

The AI uses a sophisticated second brain scoring system that heavily favors personal knowledge:

### Maximum Value (9-10 points)
- Personal financial data (investments, 401k, portfolio tracking): +5 points
- Personal medical/health records (symptoms, treatments, health tracking): +5 points  
- Original thoughts and insights (unique ideas, aha moments): +4 points
- Personal learning synthesis (combining sources with your understanding): +4 points
- Life experiences and stories (travel, relationships, major events): +4 points
- API keys, passwords, credentials: +5 points

### High Value (7-8 points)
- Personal project tracking (goals, habits, progress logs): +4 points
- Career development (job history, performance reviews, planning): +4 points
- Book notes with personal commentary (your thoughts plus highlights): +3 points
- Daily notes and journal entries (personal reflections, planning): +3 points
- Personal workflows and systems (custom templates, processes): +3 points

### Knowledge Network Value (5-7 points)
- Multiple WikiLinks (3+ internal links): +3 points
- Tags and metadata (YAML frontmatter): +3 points
- Hub/index notes (Maps of Content): +3 points
- Personal research with insights: +2 points
- Obsidian links: +2 points

### Major Penalties
- Copy-pasted content without personal input: -4 points
- No WikiLinks or tags: -3 points
- Easily recreated from Google/Wikipedia: -4 points
- Empty placeholder notes: -3 points

## Auto-Decision System

Configure intelligent automation to speed up your review:

### Auto-Keep (Default: 7+ points)
High-scoring personal notes are automatically kept, letting you focus on borderline cases.

### Auto-Delete (Optional: 2- points)  
Very low-scoring notes can be auto-deleted. This feature is disabled by default for safety.

### Configuration Example
```
Configure auto-decision settings? (y/n): y

Auto-Decision Configuration
Enable auto-keep for high-scoring notes? (currently: YES) (y/n): y
Current auto-keep threshold: 7
Enter new threshold (7-10) or press Enter to keep current: 8

Enable auto-delete for low-scoring notes? (currently: NO) (y/n): n

Show auto-decision notifications? (currently: YES) (y/n): y

Configure file size limit? (currently: 20KB max) (y/n): n

Show skipped large files? (currently: YES) (y/n): y

Include subfolders when scanning? (currently: YES) (y/n): y

Configuration saved!
Auto-keep: Notes scoring 8+ will be kept automatically
Notifications: Enabled
File size limit: 20KB maximum
Show skipped files: Enabled
Subfolders: Included
```

### Subfolder Configuration

The tool can be configured to scan only the root directory or include all subfolders:

- **Include Subfolders (Default)**: Scans all markdown files recursively throughout the vault
- **Root Only**: Scans only markdown files in the vault root directory, ignoring subfolders

This is useful for:
- **Large Vaults**: Skip subfolder archives or reference materials
- **Organized Vaults**: Focus only on top-level notes while preserving organized subfolder content
- **Selective Cleanup**: Clean main notes while keeping project-specific subfolder notes untouched

## AI Note Enhancement System

Transform sparse notes into valuable knowledge assets with complete safety:

### Enhancement Features
- **Complete Content Safety**: Triple-layer safety system ensures no existing text is ever deleted or modified
- **Atomic Note Creation**: Automatically identifies concepts that should be separate notes and creates them
- **Intelligent Linking**: Scans vault for existing notes and creates [[WikiLinks]] connections
- **Knowledge Graph Building**: Connects notes to build a comprehensive knowledge network
- **Concept Extraction**: Uses AI to identify 3-5 key concepts that deserve their own atomic notes
- **Intelligent Content Addition**: AI adds meaningful content while preserving original text
- **Automatic Re-evaluation**: Enhanced notes get fresh AI analysis
- **Score Tracking**: See immediate improvements (e.g., 5/10 to 8/10)

### Triple-Layer Safety System

**Layer 1: AI Safety Instructions**
- Explicit warnings in AI prompt to never delete or modify existing content
- Clear visual markers showing forbidden vs. allowed actions
- Repeated emphasis on preserving all original content exactly as written

**Layer 2: Content Validation**
- Automatic verification that all original content is preserved
- Line-by-line checking to ensure nothing was removed or changed
- Length validation (enhanced content must be longer than original)

**Layer 3: Safety Fallback**
- Automatic rejection if any original content is missing
- Returns original content unchanged if validation fails
- Clear user notification when safety checks trigger

## Atomic Notes & Zettelkasten Integration

The enhancement system follows atomic note principles for building a true "second brain":

### What Are Atomic Notes?
- **One Concept Per Note**: Each note contains a single, focused idea
- **Self-Contained**: Understandable without requiring other notes
- **Highly Linkable**: Designed to connect with other atomic concepts
- **Reusable**: Can be referenced in multiple contexts

### How the AI Creates Atomic Notes
1. **Concept Identification**: AI analyzes content to identify 3-5 key concepts
2. **Vault Scanning**: Checks existing notes to avoid duplicates
3. **Atomic Note Creation**: Creates new notes for concepts that don't exist
4. **Intelligent Linking**: Updates original note with [[WikiLinks]] to atomic notes
5. **Knowledge Graph Building**: Connects related concepts automatically

### Benefits of This Approach
- **No Duplicate Information**: Concepts exist once but are linked everywhere
- **Scalable Knowledge**: Easy to find and connect related ideas
- **Emergent Insights**: Connections reveal new relationships between concepts  
- **Future-Proof**: New notes automatically connect to existing atomic concepts
- **Better Search**: Find information through multiple entry points

ARN (Amazon Resource Name)

Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) uniquely identify [[AWS Resources]] across all of AWS. They provide a standardized way to reference resources regardless of the AWS region or account.

## Format
ARNs follow this general format:
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id

## Common Examples
- S3 Bucket: arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name
- Lambda Function: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:my-function
- IAM Role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role

## Best Practices

### For Second Brain Optimization
1. **WikiLinks are Essential**: Notes without internal links or tags get penalty points
2. **Personal Over Generic**: Your thoughts and insights score much higher than copied content  
3. **Connected Knowledge**: Hub notes with many outgoing links are highly valued
4. **Original Synthesis**: Combining multiple sources with your understanding gets top scores

### Review Strategy
1. **Configure Auto-Decisions**: Set auto-keep at 7+ to skip obvious keepers
2. **Focus on Middle Range**: Spend time on 3-6 score notes that need human judgment
3. **Use View Option**: Press 'v' to see full content when unsure
4. **Enhance Instead of Delete**: Press 'e' to improve sparse notes rather than deleting useful stubs
5. **Trust the Re-evaluation**: Enhanced notes get fresh scoring

### Enhancement Strategy
1. **Use Fearlessly**: Complete content safety means you can enhance any note without risk
2. **Target Sparse Notes**: Perfect for basic definitions, concept stubs, short explanations
3. **Let AI Create Atomic Notes**: System automatically identifies concepts worthy of separate notes
4. **Review the Knowledge Graph**: Enhanced notes create [[WikiLink]] connections to existing notes
5. **Preview Everything**: Always review enhanced content and new atomic notes before saving
6. **Watch Score Improvements**: Enhanced notes typically jump 3-5 points due to better linking
7. **Build Connected Knowledge**: Turn isolated notes into an interconnected knowledge network

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies: `google-generativeai`, `colorama`, `tqdm`
- Gemini API key (free from Google AI Studio)
- Internet connection for AI analysis and enhancement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Error:**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-key-here"
```
Make sure quotes are included and key is valid.

**File Permission Error:**
Ensure write permissions for vault directory and that files aren't locked by Obsidian during review.

**Unicode/Encoding Error:**  
Files with encoding issues are skipped with warnings. UTF-8 encoding is assumed for all markdown files.

**Rate Limit Issues:**
Script includes intelligent rate limiting handling with exponential backoff:
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects API rate limiting errors automatically
- **Smart Retry**: Uses exponential backoff (5s ‚Üí 10s ‚Üí 20s ‚Üí 40s ‚Üí 60s) with random jitter
- **Progress Preservation**: Shows retry status without losing your review progress
- **Maximum Attempts**: Retries up to 5 times before giving up on a request
- **Graceful Degradation**: If all retries fail, the review continues with manual scoring

Example rate limit handling:
```
‚è≥ API rate limited. Waiting 5.3s before retry 1/5...
‚è≥ API rate limited. Waiting 10.7s before retry 2/5...
```

### Performance Tips
1. **Fresh Start Default**: Script defaults to starting fresh sessions for safety
2. **Start with Auto-Keep**: Configure threshold to automatically keep high-value notes
3. **Use Enhancement Liberally**: Better to enhance and keep than to delete potentially useful content
4. **Progressive Cleanup**: Review in chunks, use session continuation for large vaults
5. **Backup First**: Always backup before major cleanup sessions
6. **Smart Token Management**: Tool uses 80% of Gemini's 1M token limit, allowing vaults up to ~800K tokens to load full content
7. **Subfolder Control**: Exclude subfolders to focus on main notes and reduce token usage
